#' Convenient Computation of Powers and Box Cox Transformation
#'
#' Are you tired of using the power operator, \code{^} or \code{**} in R?
#' Use this package to call functions that apply common powers
#' to your vectors.
#' 
#' Is your data suffering from non-normality or heteroscedasticity? Fear not, use
#' the Box-Cox transformation function bc_transform() in this package to lower the
#' variance and normalize your data!
